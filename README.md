# scRNA-seq Analysis for Advanced System Physiology  

This repository contains the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) projects I conducted for the **Advanced System Physiology** class during my second year of a Master's in Bioinformatics.  

## 📂 Project Overview  
There are **two projects**:  
1. **Guided Project** 🧬 – All students worked on the same dataset, following a predefined workflow.  
2. **Free Project** 🏋️ – I explored the impact of **physical exercise** on the **cellular composition and transcriptomics** of muscle cells.  

## 📜 Contents  
Each project includes:  
✔ A **detailed report** explaining each step of the analysis.  
✔ The **R Markdown files** containing the full analysis workflow.  

The **guided project** provides a precise **pipeline description** and a **step-by-step explanation** of the methodology used.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
To explore the analysis, you can check the provided R Markdown files and reports for a detailed breakdown of the workflow.
